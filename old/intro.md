Win
-----

I've never won anything. Once, at a golf tournament, I won a Yankees
hat. But [I'm a Red Sox fan][red-sox-fan], so I gave it away for a
3-pack of Titleists and a brownie.

But at [GoRuCo][goruco] 2009, my ship came in: I won a copy of [_Ruby
Cookbook_][ruby-cookbook] by Lucas Carlson and Leonard
Richardson. Nice!

  [ruby-cookbook]: http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596523695/

When I recovered from the [after-party][], I cracked it open and scanned
the TOC. Chapter 11! _"XML and HTML"!_ Why, that's what I do all day
long! What pearls of wisdom lay in store for me between pages 371 and
408?

As it turns out, Chapter 11 is kind of a dud. Published in 2006, this
section in particular is really showing its age. [Nokogiri][] hadn't
been born yet, and Hpricot was just a glint in \_why's eye. Most of
the examples are solved using [REXML][], although [libxml-ruby][]
makes a brief cameo as well.

  [REXML]: http://www.germane-software.com/software/rexml/
  [libxml-ruby]: http://libxml.rubyforge.org/

Technology moves fast! We can do better than REXML these days. My
personal favorite XML/HTML library is Nokogiri, which (I'm sure I
don't have to tell you, as you are a handsome/beautiful genius)
[performs well in benchmarks][xml-truth], supports XPath and CSS
queries and has lots of other nice features.

Then it hit me: _The world needs a Nokogiri Cookbook!_ I'll generate
some useful documentation, unicorns and rainbows will frolic together,
and global warming will be stopped in its tracks. __Win!__

So, welcome to the Nokogiri Cookbook, demonstrating Nokogiri's sweet
awesomeness. It'll be fun! I promise.
